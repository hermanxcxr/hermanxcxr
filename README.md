### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>
I'm Herman, Electronic engineer with a Master in Business Administration (MBA), who, in his last job, developed applications and processes based on data analytics in order to make them fundamental in decision making, improving results in operations, such as inventory optimization.
</p>
<p>
Since then, I have focused on improving my skills in analytical tools such as statistics (Descriptive and Inferential), Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Scraping tools), Excel, BI tools (Power BI, Tableau) and databases (SQL, PostgreSQL).
</p>
<p>
I am looking to work as a data analyst or data scientist.
